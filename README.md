# node-merkle-tree
Merkle Tree implementation in NodeJS <br> [![Licence](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)]()
<br><br>
Currently under development. This will generate a Merkle Tree object from a file or an array. For the array, if the elements in the array is a list of hashes, they will be used as the leaves in the Merkle Tree. Otherwise, each element will be hashed to become a leaf.

Once the basic implementation is done, proofs and verification methods will be added.
